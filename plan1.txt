I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end. Make sure you fix all the linting, compilation or validation issues after successful implementation of the plan.

### Observations

Based on my comprehensive exploration of the Health Insurance Help Desk codebase, I've identified this as a substantial Next.js application with Prisma, NextAuth, Stripe integration, and AWS S3 document handling. The project has a solid foundation but requires significant completion work across multiple areas: incomplete business logic (family members, MFA, document generation), missing infrastructure setup (database migrations, environment variables), zero test coverage, security hardening, and production readiness improvements. The codebase shows good architectural patterns but has numerous TODOs and placeholder implementations that need to be addressed.

### Approach

The implementation plan focuses on completing the remaining critical features and infrastructure setup to make this health insurance platform production-ready. The approach prioritizes: 1) Infrastructure foundation (database, environment, security), 2) Core business logic completion (family members, document generation, MFA), 3) Testing implementation, 4) Production hardening. Each step builds upon previous work while maintaining the existing architectural patterns and ensuring seamless integration with current functionality.

### Reasoning

I systematically explored the codebase by first understanding the project structure and dependencies, then analyzing the database schema and main application components. I conducted targeted searches for TODOs and incomplete features, examined the database and environment setup, analyzed the testing infrastructure (or lack thereof), and performed a comprehensive security review. I also reviewed key business logic files, UI components, and email templates to understand the complete scope of remaining work.

## Proposed File Changes

### .env.example(NEW)

References: 

- .env.local

Create a comprehensive environment variables template file that includes all required variables identified in the codebase analysis. Include sections for:

- Database configuration (DATABASE_URL)
- NextAuth configuration (NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET)
- Stripe payment configuration (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
- AWS S3 configuration (AWS_REGION, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_S3_BUCKET)
- SMTP email configuration (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_SECURE, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_FROM)
- Application configuration (NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL, NODE_ENV)
- Optional Redis configuration for distributed rate limiting (REDIS_URL)

Include comments explaining each variable's purpose and example values where appropriate. This addresses the missing environment template identified in the environment analysis.

### prisma\migrations(NEW)

References: 

- prisma\schema.prisma

Create the migrations directory to house database migration files. This directory will be populated when the initial migration is created using `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`.

### prisma\seed.ts(NEW)

References: 

- prisma\schema.prisma
- src\lib\prisma.ts
